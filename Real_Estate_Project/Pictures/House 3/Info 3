The Residences - Features

Green Building

The country's premier residential building is registered under the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) rating system, which administers the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).
Non-toxic paint is used for all surfaces, while finishes, carpets, fabric and other materials have low levels of potentially toxic chemicals to protect indoor environmental quality.

Water And Energy Efficiency

- Save 35% on your water bills through the use of low-flow and low-flush systems for water consumption.

- Collected rain water is used to water the building landscaping and for maintenance.

- Save 25% on your electricity bill with the high-efficiency lighting motion sensors that automatically switch off when an area is unoccupied.

- The building structure integrates foliage, shading, and high solar reflectance surfaces to reduce the "heat island effect" and to maximize energy savings in cooling the building.

Makati Place' The City Club Ameneties

The City Club is three hectares of leisure, entertainment and business options, right in Makati's central business district. No other club offers all these options in one place.
The City Club is an integral component of Alphaland Makati Place. All residential unit owners are automatically members of the City Club, and non-residents may also purchase memberships. Located on Ayala Avenue Extension, The City Club occupies the top three floors of the six-storey podium, with an area of 30,000 square meters. It is within walking distance of most of the major offices, residential buildings, and commercial establishments in Makati. This provides for convenience from work, home, and everywhere in between.

The overall quality of the interiors and finishes meet or exceed that of a five-star hotel, providing an elegant but understated background to the many activities available, and making it an attractive place to spend time with friends and family.
